# ShadowSwitch
ShadowSwitch is a distribution-agnostic Linux privacy dashboard built with Python and CustomTkinter. It automates and verifies complex anonymity tasks—MAC/hostname randomization, firewall killswitches, and Tor/DNS-over-HTTPS routing—into a single-click GUI. Designed to bridge the gap between CLI scripts and a modern security user experience.
